To perform a sensor fusion on light, GPS and mgnetic field sensors, run each folder consequently in this way:

1. Light
2. GPS
3. Magnetic
4. Light_GPS_Fusion
5. Light-GPS-Magnetic-Fusion

After running all the Matlab files, you will get final fusion result as a step function
(similar to a binary classification) of indoor and outdoor areas
