---------------------------------------------

To evaluate indoor-outdoor transitions, each time you need to 
take only one dataset from one of the directories like Agness33_Data e.g. to evaluate one light sensor dataset, you need to add a light file to current folder
and execute 'For_light.m'

Note: When you finished execution and seeing the result, you must delete that file and replace it e.g. a Geolocation dataset to evaluate
GPS signal.

Good Luck!
