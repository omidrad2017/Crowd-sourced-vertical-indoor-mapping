NodeRedLod2Plus.java class is used to generate a JAR file, callable through Node-RED. It is useful for generation of CityGML LoD2+ bulding models from OSM. If you parse a list of coordinates of a building footprint in terms of latitudes and longitudes in a CSV format, it will generate corresponding CityGML model of that building.
