To perform binary classification of GPS Uncertainty, please select any of the Geolocation csv files from the folders
and execute the MATLAB code OITransition_Geolocation.m

Each folder is from data I collected from a specific building.

Note: Please make sure during execution of the code, you have only one *.csv file in the main folder.
